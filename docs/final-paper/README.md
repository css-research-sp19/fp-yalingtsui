Hi Professor, 

I just found that I uploaded an intermediate version of my final paper before deadline. So I submitted my real final papr which named as "Real-Final-Paper".
The only difference these two files is that I adjust the location of some figures. I hope you could check my real final paper. Sorry for any inconvenience I've brought for you.
